Updated README coming soon...

A shell project I implemented in my Computer Systems class

Written in C, uses custom implementations of a hashmap and dynamically resizable array

This is still one of my first assignments in C, so some of the code may be pretty unoptimized and messy!

Instructions
1. Use Makefile, type make
2. Execute with ./nush
